# ARDUINOPONICS
## Summary 
Arduinoponics is a prototype of an automated aquaponics* system. It uses a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino with environmental sensors to collect real-time data from the system then displays the data through a web browser interface.

## Tech Used:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Socket.io
* React.js
* Johnny-Five.js
* Brunch
* Passport
* Arduino Uno
* Raspberry Pi
* Debian (Raspberry OS)

## Hardware:
